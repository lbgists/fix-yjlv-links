This is a one-time use script to fix blog domain name change in my old Blogger 
blog for those internal links, that is one of post linking to another of the 
same Blogger blog.

Basically, in fix.py

    newh = html.replace('***FROM***', '***TO***')

It uses Blogger export file to get the posts and pages HTML and update via 
Blogger API, some codes are from my other projects b.py [1] and bea [2].

It should be used as follows:

    # ./fix.py --client-id $CLIEND_ID --client-secret $CLIENT_SECRET \
      blog-MM-DD-YYYY.xml

Two files are created:

* blog-MM-DD-YYYY.xml.cache: cache file in JSON
* fix.dat: authenticated credential for Blogger API

The code is written in Python 3 and licensed under the MIT License.
